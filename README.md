First time using github and my first ever project.
This project was inspired by a few algo tutorials on youtube 
Biggest inspiration is MoonDev

Some fixes to issues I run into.
Pip install lumibot
Pip install transformers 
pip install torch
pip install 
#Make sure to "conda activate" 
#Let pip installations completely finish they take awhile (root cause of recent problems)
#Future Plans: I plan on making this able to work with Alpaca's Crypto API
